/**
 * The migration is only worth anything if a student reads the same number after
 * it as before. This compares, for every student and every course, the average
 * computed from the database against the one computed from the JSON files the
 * site serves today.
 *
 * The same function does the arithmetic on both sides, so what is under test is
 * the data — grades, totals and coefficients — not the formula. The formula has
 * its own unit tests.
 *
 * Only the courses listed in import-map.json are compared: they are the ones the
 * database is supposed to hold. Opening the catalogue widens this test for free.
