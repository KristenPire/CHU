# Exam Results Viewer

[![CI](https://github.com/KristenPire/CHU/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=preprod)](https://github.com/KristenPire/CHU/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Terminal-themed student exam results viewer built for the EPITA × Chang'an University collaboration.

Three teachers share this site — each manages their own class (`net`, `os`, `fp`). Students log in with their ID, pick a class tab, and review their graded MCQs question by question.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npm create vite@latest exam-results -- --template react
cd exam-results
npm install
npm install framer-motion
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

Add Tailwind to `vite.config.js`:
```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
});
```

Then replace `src/` with this folder and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Local database

The V1 stores grades in PostgreSQL instead of the JSON files of `src/data/`. The
database runs in Docker so that every contributor — and the CI — uses the exact
same version. Requires Docker (or Docker Desktop) running.

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then edit the password if you want
docker compose up -d db       # starts postgres:18-alpine
docker compose ps             # wait for STATUS = healthy (a few seconds)
```

Connect with `psql` inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB"
```

Stop it, keeping the data (named volume `pgdata`):

```bash
docker compose down
```

Reset it — **deletes every row**, useful to replay the migrations from an empty
database:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

`.env` holds the credentials and is gitignored; `.env.example` is the committed
reference. `DATABASE_URL` is the only variable the application code reads. The
port is published on `127.0.0.1` only, so the database is never reachable from
the local network.

If `docker compose up` fails with `address already in use`, another PostgreSQL
already holds the port. Set `DB_PORT` to a free one in `.env` and update the
port inside `DATABASE_URL` to match:

```bash
DB_PORT=5433
DATABASE_URL=postgres://chu:local-dev-password@127.0.0.1:5433/chu_grades
```

See `docs/adr/0004-docker-compose-environments.md` for why the database runs in
Docker rather than being installed on each machine.

Once the container is healthy, build the schema and load the data:

```bash
npm run migrate                # applies src/db/migrations/*.sql in order
npm run import                 # loads the courses listed in src/db/import-map.json
npm run test:integration       # runs against a separate <database>_test
```

`migrate` and `import` are separate on purpose: the schema is versioned and
applied once, the grades are data that get corrected and reloaded. Both are
safe to run again — `migrate` skips what it already applied, `import` upserts
and leaves the audit journal alone when nothing changed.

`import-map.json` decides which course folders of `src/data/` are imported. It
holds one entry today: the chain is validated on Python OOP for the 2025
promotion before the rest of the catalogue is opened. Folders absent from it
are reported and skipped.

See `docs/database.md` for the schema and the rules the database enforces, and
`docs/adr/0003-postgresql-access-and-migrations.md` for why there is no ORM.

## Contributing

### Branches

| Branch | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `master` | Production. Built and published to GitHub Pages on `chu-epita.xyz`, read by students. Receives one pull request from `preprod` at the end of the V1, nothing else. |
| `preprod` | Integration branch for the V1. Every feature merges here. |
| `feat/<slug>` | One branch per feature, created from `preprod`, short English slug. |

Direct pushes to `master` and `preprod` are refused: both require a pull
request. See `docs/adr/0002-branching-strategy.md` for why.

### Working on a feature

```bash
git checkout preprod && git pull
git checkout -b feat/<slug>
# … work, in small commits …
npm run check          # same command the CI runs
git push -u origin feat/<slug>
```

The push triggers a pre-push hook that runs `npm run check` and refuses the push
if it fails. The hook is installed by `npm install` (`prepare` script); it is a
convenience and can be bypassed with `--no-verify`, but the same check is
required on the pull request, so bypassing it only defers the failure.

Then open a pull request against `preprod`. It cannot be merged until the `check`
job is green. `docs/testing.md` lists what is checked and what blocks a merge.

### Checks

```bash
npm run check     # the single entry point — lint today, more later
npm run lint      # ESLint alone
npm run build     # production build, as the Pages deployment runs it
```

`check` is what the hook and the CI call, verbatim. New checks are added to that
one script, so a contributor never has to read the workflow to know what will
run.

### Commits

Conventional Commits, in English, one commit per logical step — a migration, a
script, a test, a route, a screen — in the order the work is built. No squash,
no interactive rebase, no amend on something already pushed.

Each message has a body that says *why*: the context, and the alternative that
was rejected when it is relevant. The footer links the commit to its task.

```
feat(db): add grades table with audit trigger

Every grade change must be traceable (who/what/when) before opening the
teacher area. A trigger on UPDATE copies the previous row into
grade_audit; done in SQL rather than app code so imports are covered too.

Refs: BDD-29
```

### Architecture decisions

Any structural choice — framework, database, driver, hosting, authentication,
test strategy — gets a file in `docs/adr/` following `docs/adr/TEMPLATE.md`, and
that file is committed **before** the code it justifies.

### What never enters the repository

Student names, credentials, `.env`, and the teacher working folders
(`document/`, `C++GroupGrading/`). The JSON files in `src/data/` are the import
format of reference: write code that reads them, do not reshape them.

```

## How It Works

### Screen Flow

```
LoginScreen → DashboardScreen → ExamDetailScreen
                  ↑                    │
                  └────────────────────┘
```

1. **Login** — student enters their ID in a fake terminal prompt
2. **Dashboard** — shows their name, weighted average for the selected class, and a list of exam cards. Class tabs (`Net | OS | FP`) filter everything.
3. **Exam Detail** — question-by-question breakdown with color-coded answers and expandable explanations

### Data Loading

`data/index.js` uses Vite's `import.meta.glob` to auto-discover every `info.json`, `body.json`, and `students.json` inside `data/<class>/<number>/`. No imports to maintain — drop a folder, restart dev server, done.

The "wrong-only" student format gets expanded at load time: questions NOT listed in `wrong` are assumed correct, and the scoring engine receives a full answer array either way.

### Grade Display

Grades are provided by teachers in `students.json`. The app just displays them.
Weighted average = `Σ(grade × coeff) / Σ(coeff)`, computed per class in `data/index.js`.

---

## How To Change Things

### "I want to change the colors"

Edit `src/index.css` — all colors are defined in `@theme`:
```css
--color-tm-cyan: #00d4ff;    /* accent color */
--color-tm-green: #00ff41;   /* correct / success */
--color-tm-red: #ff3333;     /* wrong / error */
--color-tm-yellow: #ffd700;  /* partial / warning */
--color-tm-bg: #0a0a1a;      /* page background */
```

These generate Tailwind classes: `text-tm-cyan`, `bg-tm-green`, `border-tm-red`, etc.

For dynamic colors used in JS (score-based), edit the `C` object in `theme.js`.

### "I want to change the animations"

Edit `src/theme.js` — all framer-motion presets are exported:
- `fadeSlide` — screen transitions
- `scaleIn` — login terminal entrance
- `stagger` / `staggerItem` — card list animations
- `shake` — wrong ID error
- `delayedFade(delay)` / `delayedScale(delay)` — login sequence

To remove all animations: replace motion components with regular `div`s and remove framer-motion import.

### "I want to change the login screen look"

Edit `src/screens/LoginScreen.jsx`. The terminal frame is pure HTML/Tailwind — title bar, traffic light dots, prompt line. No SVG, no images.

### "I want to change how scores are displayed"

Edit the relevant screen:
- Dashboard average → `DashboardScreen.jsx`
- Exam card preview → `ExamCard` in `components.jsx`
- Question detail → `QuestionCard` in `components.jsx`

### "I want to change the weighted average logic"

Edit `computeWeightedAverage()` in `data/index.js`.

### "I want to change the grade thresholds (colors/labels)"

Two places:
- `gradeColor()` in `theme.js` — picks green/yellow/red based on percentage
- Grade label (`EXCELLENT/GOOD/PASS/FAIL`) in `ExamDetailScreen.jsx`

### "I want to add a new body type (not MCQ)"

1. Add the new format in `body.json` with a different `bodyType`
2. Add a scoring function in `scoring.js`
3. Add a new card component in `components.jsx`
4. Add a conditional render in `ExamDetailScreen.jsx` based on `bodyType`

### "I want to deploy this"

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist/` folder is a static site — drop it on any hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or a simple nginx). No backend needed.
